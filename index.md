### Hello, I'm Natália. I am an artist who merges design with inner world of individuals. I strive to create designs that resonate with others on a profound level, allowing each person to find their own depths and experience their unique emotions. If I am not currently working on some graphics, I am most likely taking pictures of hidden gems of funcionalist architecture.
