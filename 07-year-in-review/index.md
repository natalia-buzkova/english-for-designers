# Year in Review

by Natália Búzková

11 April 2024

## Insights, things I learned, etc.

We can look at the "year" period in three different ways.
The first is the time starting in April 2023 to April 2024, as in 365 days. The second is the school year, from September 2023 to April 2024. The last one is 2024 itself, so the last four months.

I decided I am going to dig deeper into lessons I've learned during the last 365 days. 
Since april 2022, I started a tradition of reviewing each month on my second Instagram account, so I have all the information that I need. 

I have also started keeping track of emotions that are specific to each day, by keeping a Year in pixels diary. 

Looking back, I've come a long way and I've learned a lot in the field of my career, but especially in my personal life. 

### School and Career
- Keeping my vision clear and not giving up on it is crucial
- Planning saves me some precious time in the future 
- Realizing that I have the ability to help people with my work
- Improving my skills in adobe programs and github

### Personal Life
- Realizing that I can choose who I give my energy to
- Learning that there is no such thing as too many therapy sessions
- Seeing that time really heals
- Accepting that politics is forbidden theme in my family
