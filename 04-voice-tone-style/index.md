# Voice, Tone, and Style

### My *own* content style guide 

I have spent my forming years mostly on academic earth of my high school, together with my teachers who majored in psychology, tutors whose passion was art and friends who experienced their first heartbreaks. So just like that, I became a *therapist* to my whole friend group, teaching them how to deal with their struggles and teaching myself how to relax and find peace in art, which was the only part of my life I didn't need to excel in (*or let's just say I somehow accepted it... at least tried to*)
