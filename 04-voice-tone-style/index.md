# Voice, Tone, and Style

#### My *own* content style guide 

I have spent my forming years mostly on academic earth of my high school, together with my teachers who majored in psychology, tutors whose passion was art and friends who experienced their first heartbreaks. So just like that, I became a *therapist* to my whole friend group, teaching them how to deal with their struggles and teaching myself how to relax and find peace in art, which was the only part of my life I didn't need to excel in (*or let's just say I somehow accepted it... at least tried to*.)  

## Voice

If I were to describe myself, I'd talk about the deepest parts together with smallest details about my life, just to make sure you completely understand me. (*It might have something to do with my need for validation*.)

1. #### Personal
I don't like small talks. Small talks mean general conversations which is pretty much shallow and if I love something, then its depth. I don't want to hear about today's weather, tell me something about your childhood.  

2. #### Honest
I've spent years trying to fit in, which resulted into abandonig myself. Today I strive to be my truest self and especially in the way I communicate.  

3. #### Open-minded
I have always wanted people to feel safe and themselves around me. I am open to see new perspectives and there is no topic I would judge you for. Of course there are some differences now and then, but in that case we can just agree to disagree.
   
## Tone


1. #### Friendly
The last thing I want is for people to feel that they are not welcome around me. Even though I often act introverted or distanced, I am always open to friendly one-on-one conversation. 

2. #### Comforting
My friends often say I act as both their parent or lifelong partner. Do you need to talk about your problem in the tiniest detail and then replay it ten times or do you just need someone to make you a cup of tea and listen to you? I can do both and I am happy to do so. 

3. #### Direct
When it comes down to business, I express my needs and expectations without beating around the bush. I'm open about what my goals and vision is and I'm not afraid to be assertive. I've learned that at the end of the day, it's a win-win for both sides. 
   
## Style

1. #### Detailed
Some may say it's oversharing, overexplaining or even people-pleasing. Maybe it's all of the above, but I always try to convey as much detial as possible to avoid some kind of misunderstanding.

2. #### Ask questions
My closest friends know that I ask them how they feel at least three times a week. And also how is their day, their work, if they got that A from their exam that we studied for together and so on. And I always ask *How do yo feel?* instead of *How are you?* 

3. #### Polite
I don't separate formal and informal communication when it comes to politeness. I treat the other person as I wish them to treat me. I don't influence the other person's reaction, but I can influence my own action. So it should always be *human*.
