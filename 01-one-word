# word "OK"
My word is a simple OK, not okay, 'kay, or whatever form of this word, but “OK”. I was thinking of finding a better or more complex one, but then I came back to the one that was in my mind from the beginning and the one that I literally hate. This simple ok could mean so many things that it often drives me crazy.

	First of all, when you get a text from your mom saying ok, it just means “okay, fine, sure” and has no other connotation than positive or neutral one. Even if you use ok in a formal email, there is no trace of some underlaying conflict, it’s just a sign of acceptance or agreement as it is supposed to.
	However, ok has a very different side to it if used in informal conversation between two or more people who are currently in some kind of conflict, which may or may not be so obvious to the person to whom is the word being said to. Then it gets interesting. Many times someone would just reply to me with simple ok when it was pretty clear the situation was everything but not okay. I understand and respect the fact that there are some people who cannot communicate an issue clearly because they are not aware of their emotions and their ok is all they can provide at the moment. But there are also people who use the word to mess with someone's head and instead of replying meaningfully they keep you on your toes.
	I absolutely hate it when you can physically feel the mess that is hidden behind these two syllables and even when you try your best to somehow dig into the word and find that message behind it, you just do not get the clear answer, but sometimes even more OK’s.

	All in all, the reason why I hate the word Ok is because it is often so unclear to me what is being said and has been used so many times to manipulate me that I rather just not see it at all.
