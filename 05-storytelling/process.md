# Attachment styles

- Read the [Article](index.md)

## Choosing a topic

I knew from the beginning what my talk is going to be about. For the last year, when I wasn't focusing on school or enjoying my free time differently, I spent my time reading books about attachment styles, trauma and childhood. 

## Working on content and connection

Then I struggled and stopped my process for a while because I didn't know how to connect these themes to my own life and offer an insight into my inner self. 

I decided to write out some notes of what I think defines me.

Then I highlighted some of the information that stood out.

## Thinking of the story

After that I lay down and thought about how to create a story that would be personal, but also beneficial for my audience. 

## Gathering information
I read a few articles just to refresh my memory, but I mainly I used information found in books. 

## Writing
I decided to make written article as the fist step in presentation and after that the presentation itself.
