## Introduction

If I were to come up with one sentence that would describe me as both a designer and an individual, it would be this: *I am an artist who merges design with inner world of individuals.*

There was a moment when creative work evolved into a powerful tool for navigating my own emotions. Following the loss of my brother, art served as a lifeline that kept our connection alive.
It has been eight years since I immersed myself in the studies of mental health and the human soul. 

I strive to create designs that resonate with others on a profound level, allowing each person to find their own depths and experience their unique emotions. 
In the future, I would like to use my work as a medium to comfort individuals, reminding them that they are not alone in their struggles.  

## Projects

I decided to show these three projects as it shows exactly what I talked about when I tried to describe my work as an artist, but also it shows that I do not only do graphic design, but my passion is also photography and painting. 

### Design project / game Poznanie (Cognition)

I made this work with two other classmates as our final atelier project.

Poznanie is not only a game, but also a tool to connect with your friends and yourself. It could be played by friends, could be used as a learning tool for a single person or could be integrated in psychological practice.
A card game built around pure emotions that individuals experience daily. Our goal is to learn people how to be open to not only feel those emotions, but to talk about them freely in a safe space. 
We created two levels of this game, one for kids (age 8+) and the second one for people 15+. 

The principle behind the first level is to connect puzzle-like cards in a sequence including one puzzle piece of emotion (written), then an illustration showing that specific emotion and then numerous cards with our needs that we experience when we feel that emotion. As it is primarily targeted for younger kids, these cards are made mainly for them to name various emotions and identify their needs.

Concept behind the second variation of the game is to talk about emotions that we often tend to hide or trivialize, and to learn about them. It also consists of cards, but this time we have eight different categories of questions, in which each question target one of the eight main emotions. In the pack, there are also info cards about each emotion so even one person can use this game as a learning tool. 


### Design project / painting Anxiety

Painting is a form of art in which I feel free. In my work, I always work to the point where I feel like the project is perfect, but not during painting, When I paint, I turn off my head and I often don’t even use any brush, just my hands.

With this one, I felt like I needed to visualize what I feel during my anxiety episodes. The main object is done by sewing technique and it is a clear symbolization of my own head – eye and mouth are disconnected from the rest of the head because I feel like I lost my ability to speak or to see when anxiety fills my body, and I can’t even ask for help. I also worked with glass to show not only the coldness getting from the above with the blue colour, but also how it feels like something was cutting through my skin. While everything feels as if it stopped around me, the fire inside of me is burning and to show that I used the combination of red and orange colour in the right corner. 

### Design project / book sournsweetz

I have been working on this project for few years now and I am still working on it at this moment.
Aside from graphic design, my passion is also photography and writing, so in 2019 I created a secret Instagram profile, on which I posted photos that I captured together with some of my thoughts and emotions. After two years I decided to leave the writing part out as I felt I was too open in such toxic space as Instagram often is. 

This year, we have a semester work on Typography to create our own book, so I decided to make my dream come true. Currently I am collecting my work from the past years, both photos and writings and I hope I will be able to show you my first real book soon.

This project is mostly personal for me because I use my own experiences and I write about them with open heart. Also, I see it as a tribute to my brother, as he was a professional photographer to whom I look up to and I always will.
