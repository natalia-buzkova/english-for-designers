To put it simply, OK comes with so many possible interpretations. And that often drives me crazy. Language is a powerful tool that enables effective communication, expression of thoughts, emotions, and ideas. Yet, the usage of the word OK, even though it only consists of two syllables, usually leads to confusion. 

Let's strats with its meaning. It can vary depending on the context and the speaker’s intention. There's a time when it is a sign of acceptance or agreement. Like when you get a text from your mom, it has no other meaning than a positive or neutral one. (Or at least most of the time.) Even if you use OK in a formal email, there is no trace of some underlying conflict or irony. (Maybe.) 
	Yet, the word has a very different side to it if used in informal conversation. Like between two or more people who are currently in some kind of conflict. Sadly, it may not be so obvious to the person to whom is the word being said to. (For me, it has never been *obvious*, at all.)
Many times, someone replies with a short OK when it is clear that the situation is everything but *not* okay. The person is then left alone to figure out what the real meaning is. I get that there are some people who can't communicate an issue. Maybe because they're not aware of their emotions and their ok is all they can provide at the moment. But there are also people who use the word to mess with someone's head. Leaving your head spinning.

I can't stand to feel the mess that is hidden behind these two syllables. And even when you try your best to somehow dig into the word and find that message behind it, you don't get a clear answer. Actually, sometimes even more OKs!

In my world, effective communication is the key of successful relationships. And a happy life. As someone who values meaningful exchanges, I often find the use of OK frustrating. With it's vagueness, it undermines this basic aspect of communication by failing to provide clearity and depth.
